**Athena Discord Bot: Processing Concepts, Assets, and Ads 🤖**

Welcome to the Athena Discord Bot! As an operator, your role involves transforming client-generated concepts into compelling ads. This guide walks you through the process of processing concepts, creating assets, and delivering final ads to clients.

1️⃣ **Reviewing Client Concepts** 🧐
Clients provide concepts along with relevant context. You need to ensure these meet necessary requirements.

2️⃣ **Generating Multiple Prompts** 🗣️
Using the client's concept, create additional ad variations. Use tools like the OpenAI API or other creative resources.

3️⃣ **Creating Assets: Banner and CTA** 🎨🔆
Once you have multiple prompts, create visual assets for each concept using the commands /upload_concept_banner and /upload_concept_cta. Attach the image you wish to upload with each command.

For example:

/upload_concept_banner YourConceptName (attach banner image)
/upload_concept_cta YourConceptName (attach CTA image)
Replace YourConceptName with the name of your specific concept.

4️⃣ **Assembling the Ads** 🧩
Combine the prompts and assets to create final ads. Make sure these effectively communicate the client's desired message.

5️⃣ **Templating Ads and Delivery** 📁✉️
After assembling the ads, use the /template_ads command to template ads using specific parameters. It requires the name of an input folder and a concept, and optionally the name of an output folder.

Example: /template_ads InputFolderName ConceptName OutputFolderName

The command will create an output folder, template the ads, and share it with specified email addresses.

6️⃣ **Communicating with Clients** 📣
Keep the client informed throughout the process, providing updates on progress and addressing any questions or concerns. Make sure the final ads meet their expectations and are delivered on time.

Enjoy your creative journey with Athena Discord Bot! 🎉
